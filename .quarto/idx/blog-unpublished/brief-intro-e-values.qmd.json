Unlike $p$-values, e-values provide Type-I risk control even when decision tasks are formulated post hoc. E-values can support decisions without the need to predefine a fixed significance level, allowing flexibility in interpreting evidence post hoc. Note, however, that this is a different type of control from traditional fixed-$\\alpha$ control.\n\nIn this article, we’ll explore the motivation behind e-values, define their mathematical properties, and illustrate their application using a simple example in `R` and `python`.\n\n## Notation\n\nLet’s set up the basic notation. Suppose we are testing a null hypothesis $H_0$ against an alternative $H_1$ based on observed data $Y$. In classical Neyman–Pearson testing, we define a test statistic T(Y) and derive a $p$-value:\n\n  $$P(Y) = P_{H_0}(T(Y) \\geq T_{obs}),$$\n\nwhere $P_{H_0}$ represents probability under the null hypothesis and $T_{obs}$ is the observed test statistic.\n\n## A Closer Look\n\n### Definition\n\nE-values replace this with an alternative statistic, the e-variable, denoted as $S(Y)$, which satisfies:\n\n  $$E_{H_0}[S(Y)] \\leq 1.$$\n\nThis ensures that the e-value does not, on average, exceed 1 under the null, providing a valid way to quantify evidence against $H_0$.\n\n### Why E-Values?\n\nThe fundamental problem with $p$-values is their lack of a clear decision-theoretic interpretation. They are often misunderstood and misused, leading to issues such as the replication crisis in scientific research. E-values address these issues by offering:\n\n- **Interpretability**: Large e-values provide direct evidence against $H_0$, unlike small $p$-values, which are difficult to interpret without a fixed alpha threshold.\n- **Optional Stopping**: Because e-values maintain their validity even when a study stops based on interim results, they are useful in sequential testing.\n- **Post Hoc Decision-Making**: Since e-values allow for Type-I risk control after seeing the data, they facilitate more flexible decision-making.\n\n### Constructing the E-Values\n\nA common way to define an e-value is through a likelihood ratio:\n\n  $$S(Y) = \\frac{P_{H_1}(Y)}{P_{H_0}(Y)}.$$\n\nThis is similar to a Bayes factor but differs in that it does not require a prior distribution over hypotheses. Another approach is to construct empirical e-values based on resampling methods or alternative test statistics that satisfy the expectation constraint.\n\nA more general definition involves e-processes, which allow for sequential testing. An e-process $\\{S_t\\}_{t=1}^{\\infty}$ is a sequence of nonnegative random variables satisfying:\n\n  $$E_{H_0}[S_t | S_1, \\dots, S_{t-1}] \\leq S_{t-1}, \\quad \\forall t.$$\n\nThis property ensures that the sequence remains a valid e-value throughout a study, making it particularly powerful for adaptive testing procedures.\n\nAnother important construction is via supermartingales. An e-value can be defined as a nonnegative random variable $S(Y)$ such that $\\{S_t\\}$ forms a nonnegative supermartingale under $H_0$:\n\n  $$E_{H_0}[S_t | S_{t-1}] \\leq S_{t-1},$$\n\nwhich guarantees that the expectation does not increase under the null hypothesis.\n\n## Comparison\n\n<div style=\"max-width: 400px; margin: 0 auto;\">\n\n| Property             | $P$-Value                             | E-Value                                  |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Interpretability     | Indirect (requires fixed $\\alpha$)    | Direct (large values indicate evidence)  |\n| Optional Stopping    | No                                    | Yes                                      |\n| Sequential Analysis  | Problematic                           | Natural                                  |\n| Post Hoc Decisions   | Not well-defined                      | Valid risk guarantees                    |\n\n</div>\n\n## An Example\n\nLet’s consider a simple hypothesis test using the `iris` dataset in `R`.

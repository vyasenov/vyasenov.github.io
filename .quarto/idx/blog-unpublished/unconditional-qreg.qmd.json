Traditional quantile regression, however, is *conditional*—it models quantiles of the outcome given a set of covariates. But in many policy and causal inference applications, we are interested in changes to the *unconditional* distribution of the outcome variable.\n\nFor example, suppose we want to understand the effect of a job training program on wage inequality. A standard quantile regression would tell us how the program shifts quantiles *given* certain characteristics like education or experience. But we might instead want to estimate how the program shifts quantiles *in the population as a whole*—this is where *Unconditional Quantile Regression (UQR)* comes in.\n\nThe key breakthrough in this space was provided by Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux (2009), who introduced a method based on the Recentered Influence Function (RIF). This allows us to estimate the effect of covariates on unconditional quantiles using simple linear regressions. Later, Frölich and Melly (2013) extended this framework to account for endogeneity, providing a way to estimate Unconditional Quantile Treatment Effects (UQTEs) in settings where treatment is not randomly assigned.\n\nIn this article, we’ll unpack the key ideas behind UQR, discuss how to estimate unconditional quantile treatment effects, and illustrate these concepts with an example in `R` and `python`.\n\n## Notation\n\nWe consider an outcome variable $Y$ and a set of covariates $X$. In traditional quantile regression, we estimate the conditional quantile function:\n\n  $$Q_\\tau(Y | X) = \\inf \\{ q : P(Y \\leq q | X) \\geq \\tau \\}.$$\n\nThis tells us how the $\\tau$-th quantile of Y changes with $X$. However, in many applications, we want to model the unconditional quantiles:\n\n  $$Q_\\tau(Y) = \\inf \\{ q : P(Y \\leq q) \\geq \\tau \\}.$$\n\nUQR allows us to estimate how covariates influence these unconditional quantiles.\n\n## A Closer Look\n\n### Basics: Conditional vs. Unconditional Quantiles\n\nThe fundamental distinction between conditional and unconditional quantile regressions is best understood through an example. Suppose we are studying wage distributions. A conditional quantile regression would estimate the effect of education on the *wage quantile within a specific subgroup* (e.g., workers with 5 years of experience). But what if we want to know the effect of education on the overall wage distribution? That’s where unconditional quantiles come in—they capture the **total** effect of education, accounting for all pathways through which education might influence wages.\n\n### Unconditional Quantile Regression\n\nFirpo et al. introduced an elegant way to estimate UQR using **influence functions**. The **influence function** of a statistic measures how much that statistic changes when an observation is perturbed. The **recentered influence function (RIF)** for a quantile $Q_\\tau$ is given by:\n\n  $$RIF(Y; Q_\\tau) = Q_\\tau + \\frac{\\tau - 1\\{Y \\leq Q_\\tau\\}}{f_Y(Q_\\tau)}.$$\n\nHere, $f_Y(Q_\\tau)$ is the density of $Y$ at $Q_\\tau$, which can be estimated nonparametrically. This nonparametric density estimation is often done via kernel density estimation but may be imprecise in the tails.\n\nFirpo et al. showed that regressing $RIF(Y; Q_\\tau)$ on covariates $X$ via OLS provides a valid estimate of how $X$ affects the $\\tau$-th quantile of $Y$. This method is remarkably simple but powerful—it transforms a quantile regression problem into a standard linear regression problem.\n\n### Estimation\n\nThe estimation proceeds in three steps:\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Algorithm:\"}\n1. Estimate the sample quantile $q_{\\tau}$.\n2. Estimate the density $f_Y(q_{\\tau})$, typically via kernel density estimation.\n3. Construct the RIF for each observation and regress it on the covariates.\n:::\n\nThe basic regression is:\n$$\nRIF(Y; q_{\\tau}) = X' \\beta + \\varepsilon,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\beta$ now captures the effect of $X$ on the $\\tau$-th unconditional quantile.\n\nThe most common implementation is **RIF-OLS**, though alternatives include RIF-Logit and nonparametric first stages (RIF-NP).\n\n### Inference and Challenges\n\n- **Density Estimation**: A critical step that affects the quality of inference. Poor density estimation at the quantile point can lead to noisy estimates.\n- **Nonlinearity and Model Misspecification**: RIF-OLS assumes a linear relationship between the RIF and covariates. If the true relationship is nonlinear, flexible methods (logit, nonparametric) are preferred.\n- **Standard Errors**: Because of the multi-step estimation (quantile, density, RIF), standard error computation is more complex. Bootstrapping is commonly used.\n- **Treatment Effects**: UQR is especially appealing for estimating treatment effects on the distribution of outcomes. When treatment is exogenous, including treatment indicators in the RIF regression yields estimates of the treatment effect at various unconditional quantiles.\n\n### Strengths and Applications\n\nUQR shines in settings where the policy question concerns **distributional effects**, such as:\n- Wage inequality and labor economics.\n- Health outcomes across the full distribution.\n- Policy evaluation where shifting the covariate distribution is plausible.\n\nIt also generalizes to other distributional statistics (Gini, variance) by using the corresponding influence functions.\n\n\n### Unconditional Quantile Treatment Effects\n\nOne limitation of UQR as formulated by Firpo et al. is that it assumes covariates are exogenous. But in many causal inference settings, treatment assignment is endogenous (e.g., workers self-select into training programs). Frölich and Melly (2013) extended the UQR framework to handle endogeneity using instrumental variables (IV).\n\nThey showed that under standard IV assumptions—relevance and exclusion—the unconditional quantile treatment effect (UQTE) can be estimated using a two-step approach:\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Algorithm:\"}\n1. Estimate a propensity score model (or an instrumented version of $D$) to account for selection bias.\n2. Apply RIF regression to estimate the effect of the treatment on unconditional quantiles.\n:::\n\nThis approach provides a way to estimate distributional treatment effects while addressing selection bias—a crucial tool in policy evaluation and applied econometrics.\n\n### Rank Invariance in QTEs\n\nA crucial assumption often invoked in the estimation of quantile treatment effects (QTEs) is rank invariance. This assumption states that units maintain their rank in the outcome distribution after receiving the treatment. In other words, if a treated unit was at the 30th percentile of the untreated outcome distribution, it would remain at the 30th percentile of the treated distribution.\n\nWhile this assumption simplifies identification and interpretation of QTEs, it can be highly restrictive. It rules out the possibility that treatment reshuffles individuals across the distribution—a scenario that might be not only plausible but central in many applications.\n\nConsider a school voucher program that offers private school access to low-income students. The effect of such a program may be heterogeneous: for high-performing students, access might enhance performance due to better environments. But for low-performing students, the same access could lead to worse outcomes due to higher academic pressure or poor fit. As a result, the program could re-rank students in the outcome distribution, violating rank invariance.\n\nIn such settings, assuming rank invariance could lead to misleading conclusions about who benefits and who loses from treatment. Alternative approaches, like those based on quantile treatment effect bounds (e.g., Melly, 2005; Chernozhukov & Hansen, 2005), are more robust to such violations.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Bitler et al. (2006)\n\nWhen evaluating the effects of welfare reform, traditional analyses often focus on mean impacts, which can obscure critical insights into the distributional effects of policy changes. ​ Quantile Treatment Effects (QTE) provide a powerful tool for understanding how reforms impact different segments of the population, revealing heterogeneity that mean impacts fail to capture. ​ For example, the study \"*What Mean Impacts Miss: Distributional Effects of Welfare Reform Experiments*\" by Bitler, Gelbach, and Hoynes uses QTE to analyze Connecticut's Jobs First program, a welfare reform initiative. The authors find that while mean impacts suggest modest income gains, QTE reveal substantial variation: earnings effects are zero at the bottom, positive in the middle, and negative at the top of the distribution before time limits take effect. ​ After time limits, income effects are mixed, with gains concentrated in higher quantiles and losses at the lower end. ​ This nuanced approach highlights the importance of QTE in uncovering the true breadth of policy impacts, enabling data scientists to better inform decision-making and address equity concerns in policy design.\n\n### \n\nLet’s illustrate these ideas with an example in `R` and `python`.

Should we match on covariates directly or on some summary score like the propensity score? Should we optimize the matches globally or locally? Over the years, researchers have developed a vibrant ecosystem of matching methods, each with its own philosophy, strengths, and quirks.\n\nIn this article, we’ll walk through the most popular matching strategies for causal inference. We’ll talk about what each method does, when to use it, and where it might lead you astray. The focus is on the math, intuition, and practical aspects—not on the code.\n\nWhether you’re doing matching for the first time or looking to expand your toolkit, this guide is for you.\n\n## Notation\n\nLet’s set up the basic framework. Suppose we have $n$ units indexed by $i = 1, \\dots, n$. Each unit has:\n\n- A binary treatment indicator $D_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, where $D_i = 1$ for treated units and $D_i = 0$ for controls.\n- A vector of observed covariates $X_i$.\n- Potential outcomes $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$, where $Y_i(1)$ is the outcome if treated, and $Y_i(0)$ if untreated.\n\nOur goal is to estimate treatment effects like the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) or the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT):\n$$\n\\text{ATT} = \\mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0) \\mid D = 1].\n$$\nThe core idea behind matching is to find comparable untreated units for each treated unit so we can approximate $Y(0)$ for the treated group.\n\n## A Closer Look\n\n### Exact Matching\n\nThis is the simplest and most stringent approach: match treated and control units **exactly** on all covariates $X$. If a treated unit has $X = x$, we look for control units with the exact same $X = x$.\n\n**When to use it?** When covariates are discrete and there aren’t too many of them.\n\n**Strengths:** Conceptually clear, no modeling assumptions, perfect balance on matched covariates.\n\n**Weaknesses:** Infeasible with continuous variables or many covariates (the curse of dimensionality); can lead to lots of unmatched units.\n\n---\n\n### Mahalanobis Distance Matching\n\nInstead of exact equality, Mahalanobis matching uses a distance metric:\n$$\nd_M(X_i, X_j) = \\sqrt{(X_i - X_j)^\\top S^{-1} (X_i - X_j)},\n$$\nwhere $S$ is the sample covariance matrix of $X$.\n\nIt scales and accounts for correlations among covariates, unlike Euclidean distance.\n\n**When to use it?** When covariates are continuous and moderately low-dimensional.\n\n**Strengths:** Handles continuous variables well, accounts for correlation between covariates.\n\n**Weaknesses:** Sensitive to high dimensionality; doesn’t work well with mixed discrete and continuous variables.\n\n---\n\n### Propensity Score Matching (PSM)\n\nRosenbaum and Rubin’s famous result tells us that if treatment assignment is unconfounded given $X$, it’s also unconfounded given the **propensity score**:\n$$\ne(X) = \\mathbb{P}(D = 1 \\mid X).\n$$\nPSM matches treated and control units with similar estimated propensity scores, reducing the dimensionality problem.\n\n**When to use it?** When the number of covariates is large or mostly continuous.\n\n**Strengths:** Reduces a multivariate problem to a one-dimensional one. Flexible.\n\n**Weaknesses:** Balance on the propensity score does not guarantee balance on covariates. Sensitive to propensity model misspecification.\n\n---\n\n### Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM)\n\nCEM strikes a balance between exact matching and flexibility. It **bins** continuous covariates into coarsened categories (e.g., age groups, income brackets) and then does exact matching on these coarsened values.\n\n**When to use it?** When you can meaningfully coarsen your covariates and want to retain interpretability.\n\n**Strengths:** Improves balance while avoiding the curse of dimensionality. You control the coarsening.\n\n**Weaknesses:** Requires subjective choices about how to coarsen. Coarsening too much can reduce matching quality; coarsening too little can lead to few matches.\n\n---\n\n### Optimal Matching\n\nOptimal matching minimizes the **total distance across all matched pairs**. You can think of it as solving a global optimization problem:\n$$\n\\min_{\\text{matching}} \\sum_{(i, j) \\in \\text{pairs}} d(X_i, X_j).\n$$\nThe distance can be Mahalanobis, Euclidean, or something else.\n\n**When to use it?** When you care about global match quality rather than greedy, local matching.\n\n**Strengths:** Finds globally optimal matches (not just nearest neighbor).\n\n**Weaknesses:** Computationally intensive for large datasets. Sensitive to distance metric choice.\n\n---\n\n### Nearest Neighbor Matching (NNM)\n\nThis is the workhorse of matching: for each treated unit, find the control unit(s) with the smallest distance (usually on covariates or propensity scores).\n\nVariants:\n- **With or without replacement:** Can controls be matched multiple times?\n- **One-to-one or one-to-many matching:** How many controls per treated?\n\n**When to use it?** The default starting point for matching; especially with propensity scores.\n\n**Strengths:** Simple and fast. Flexible to different distance metrics.\n\n**Weaknesses:** Greedy approach may lead to poor global balance. Matching without replacement can worsen balance.\n\n---\n\n### Genetic Matching\n\nGenetic matching uses a **genetic algorithm** to search for weights on covariates that improve balance. Think of it as automating the process of choosing the “right” distance metric.\n\nIt iteratively adjusts weights to minimize imbalance (measured by standardized mean differences) across covariates.\n\n**When to use it?** When achieving good balance is critical and standard matching methods struggle.\n\n**Strengths:** Excellent balance across covariates; data-driven weighting.\n\n**Weaknesses:** Computationally heavy. May require tuning. Randomness in the genetic algorithm introduces some variability.\n\n---\n\n### Caliper Matching\n\nCaliper matching puts a strict limit on how far apart matched units can be (e.g., match only if the propensity score difference is less than 0.1). Often used as a modification to nearest neighbor matching.\n\n**When to use it?** When you want to avoid poor matches with big distance gaps.\n\n**Strengths:** Prevents bad matches. Easy to implement alongside other methods.\n\n**Weaknesses:** May leave some treated units unmatched if no control falls within the caliper.\n\n---\n\n### Full Matching\n\nFull matching creates matched sets where each set contains at least one treated and at least one control unit. It can balance treated and control groups fully across the sample while minimizing a global imbalance measure.\n\n**When to use it?** When you don’t want to discard units and want balance across the full sample.\n\n**Strengths:** Uses all data, flexible matching ratios.\n\n**Weaknesses:** More complex to implement and analyze. Interpretability can suffer.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n- **Exact matching** is great for small, discrete covariate spaces but quickly becomes infeasible otherwise.\n\n- **Mahalanobis matching** handles continuous covariates but struggles with high dimensions.\n\n- **Propensity score matching** reduces dimensionality but needs careful balance checks and trimming.\n\n- **CEM** offers a middle ground by coarsening covariates before matching.\n\n- **Optimal and nearest neighbor matching** differ in global vs. local matching priorities.\n\n- **Genetic matching** automates the search for good weighting but at a computational cost.\n\n- **Caliper matching** helps prevent poor matches by enforcing distance thresholds.\n\n- **Full matching** balances the entire sample without discarding units.\n\n## Where to Learn More\n\nFor a thorough introduction to matching methods, start with *Matching Methods for Causal Inference* by Elizabeth Stuart (2010). The book *Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences* by Imbens and Rubin (2015) provides excellent coverage of matching and its theoretical underpinnings.

It describes situations where a trend observed within groups disappears—or even reverses—when the data is aggregated. The underlying cause is often a confounding variable that distorts the overall trend. Let’s examine a concrete example.\n\n## A Closer Look\n\n###  An Example\n\nImagine two hospitals, $A$ and $B$, treating patients for a particular condition with two treatment options, $T_1$ and $T_2$. Hospital $A$, located in a higher-income neighborhood, primarily receives healthier patients, while Hospital $B$, in a lower-income neighborhood, tends to treat sicker patients. The effectiveness of the treatments is measured as improvement in a continuous health score.\n\nWe are interested in examining whether one of the treatment options leads to better health outcomes. Consider the following data gathered across both hospitals.\n\n<div style=\"max-width: 400px; margin: 0 auto;\">\n\n| Hospital | Treatment | Health Improvement | N  |\n|----------|-----------|-------------------|-----|\n| A        | $T_1$        | 20                | 90  |\n| A        | $T_2$        | 20                | 10  |\n| B        | $T_1$        | 10                | 10  |\n| B        | $T_2$        | 10                | 90  |\n\n: Health improvement by hospital and treatment type. Both treatments $T_1$ and $T_2$ are equally effective within each hospital.\n\n</div>\n\nLet’s now look at what happens when we combine the data from both hospitals.\n\n<div style=\"max-width: 400px; margin: 0 auto;\">\n\n| Treatment | N   | Health Improvement    |\n|-----------|-----|------------------------|\n| $T_1$        | 100 | 19 = 20 * .9 + 10 * .1 |\n| $T_2$        | 100 | 11 = 10 * .9 + 20 * .1 |\n: Health improvement by treatment type. Treatment $T_1$ is more effective overall.\n\n</div>\n\nWithin each hospital, the data shows that both treatments are equally effective. However, combining the data across both hospitals reveals that treatment $T_1$ appears to be significantly more effective overall. Why does this happen?\n\nThe confounding variable here is the underlying health status of patients. Hospital $A$ treats mostly healthier patients, while Hospital $B$ handles more severe cases. This difference in patient distribution influences the overall success rates of the treatments, even though both treatments perform identically within each hospital.\n\n### A Visualization\n\nTo illustrate, imagine a scatter plot where each dot represents a patient. The color of the dot indicates the treatment they received, and the horizontal lines represent the average health improvement for each group. The vertical axis depicts the outcome variable (health improvement).\n\n:::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### R\n\n```r\n# Load required libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Set random seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(4904)\n\n# Define data dimensions\nn_a <- 200\nn_b <- 20\n\n# Create the dataset\ndata <- data.frame(\n  Hospital = rep(c(\"Hospital A\", \"Hospital B\"), each = n_a + n_b),\n  Treatment = c(\n    rep(\"Treatment 1\", n_a), rep(\"Treatment 2\", n_b),  #

We assume ideal conditions: large, random samples; well-behaved distributions; and reliable estimators.\n\nWe’re testing the null hypothesis:\n\n$$H_0: Y_1 = Y_2.$$\n\nWe denote our sample estimates as $\\hat{Y}_1$ and $\\hat{Y}_2$, with corresponding standard errors $\\hat{SE}(Y_1)$ and $\\hat{SE}(Y_2)$. The $95\\%$ confidence intervals for these estimates are:\n\n$$ \\hat{Y_1} \\pm 1.96 \\times \\hat{SE}(Y_1) $$\n\nand\n$$ \\hat{Y_2} \\pm 1.96 \\times \\hat{SE}(Y_2). $$\n\nCrucially, we can also construct a confidence interval for the difference:\n\n$$ (\\hat{Y_1} - \\hat{Y_2}) \\pm 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{ \\hat{SE}(Y_1)^2+ \\hat{SE}(Y_2)^2}. $$\n\nThis is the interval we should be analyzing when testing whether $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ differ significantly.

Reject $H_0$ if this interval does not contain 0; otherwise, do not reject.\n:::\n\n### Why the Naïve Method Fails\n\nTo understand the error, consider the following: under the naïve method, we’re implicitly relying on the interval:\n\n$$ (\\hat{Y_1} - \\hat{Y_2}) \\pm 1.96 \\times (\\hat{SE}(Y_1) + \\hat{SE}(Y_2)). $$\n\nCompare this to the statistically correct confidence interval for the difference:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\hat{SE}(Y_1)+ \\hat{SE}(Y_2)}{\\sqrt{\\hat{SE}(Y_1)^2 + \\hat{SE}(Y_2)^2}} $$\n\nThe ratio of the widths of these intervals is:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\hat{SE}(Y_1)+ \\hat{SE}(Y_2)}{\\sqrt{\\hat{SE}(Y_1)^2 + \\hat{SE}(Y_2)^2}} $$\n\nThis ratio is always greater than 1, meaning the naïve method uses a wider interval. It is more conservative when the null hypothesis is true (i.e., less likely to reject it), and less conservative when the null is false (i.e., more prone to false positives).\n\nThe discrepancy is largest when the standard errors are similar, and smallest when one standard error dominates.\n\n## An Example\n\nSchenker and Gentleman (2001) offer a helpful illustration using proportions:\n\n- $\\hat{Y}_1 = 0.56$, $\\hat{Y}_2 = 0.44$\n- $\\hat{SE}(Y_1) = \\hat{SE}(Y_2) = 0.0351$\n\nThe individual $95\\%$ confidence intervals are:\n\n- For $Y_1$: $[0.49, 0.63]$\n- For $Y_2$: $[0.37, 0.51]$\n\nThese intervals do overlap. Under the naïve method, we would not reject the null hypothesis.\n\nHowever, the confidence interval for the difference is:\n\n$$[0.02,0.22]$$\n\nThis interval does not contain $0$, meaning we would reject the null hypothesis using the correct method. The difference is statistically significant.\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n- Visual overlap of confidence intervals is an intuitive—but unreliable—method for assessing statistical significance.\n\n- This rule of thumb often misleads, particularly when standard errors are similar.\n\n- Always test for significance by examining the confidence interval for the difference between two estimates.\n\n## Where to Learn More\n\nFor a deeper exploration of this topic, including simulation results and discussion of error rates, see the two papers cited below.\n\n## References\n\nCole, S.

We know that in fuzzy RDs, the running variable can be viewed as an instrument.\n\n## Notation\n\nLet’s begin by establishing some basic notation. We aim to analyze the impact of a binary, endogenous treatment variable $X_1$ on an outcome variable $Y$, in a setting with exogenous variables $X_2$. We have access to a well-behaved, representative iid sample of size $n$ of $Y$, and $X:=[X_1, X_2]$. These variables are related as follows:\n\n  $$ Y = \\beta X_1 + \\gamma X_2 + \\epsilon, $$\n\nwhere \\epsilon is a mean-zero error term. Our goal is to obtain a consistent estimate of $\\beta$. For simplicity, we’re using the same notation for both single- and vector-valued quantities, as $X_2$ can be in $\\mathbb{R}^p$ with $ p>1$.\n\nThe challenge arises because $X_1$ and $\\epsilon$ are correlated, rendering the standard OLS estimator inconsistent. Even in large samples, $\\hat{\\beta}_{OLS}$ will be biased, and getting more data would not help. Specifically:\n\n  $$\\hat{\\beta}_{OLS} := (X'X)^{-1}X'Y \\nrightarrow \\beta. $$\n\nStandard instrument-based methods rely on the existence of an instrumental variable $Z$ which, conditional on $X_2$, correlates with $X_1$ but not with \\epsilon. Estimation then proceeds with 2SLS, LIML, or GMM, potentially yielding good estimates of $\\beta$ given appropriate assumptions. Common issues with instrumental variables include implausibility of the exclusion restriction, weak correlation with $X_1$, and challenges in interpreting $\\hat{\\beta}_{IV}$. Formally:\n\n  $$\\hat{\\beta}_{IV} := (Z'X)^{-1}Z'Y \\rightarrow \\beta. $$\n\nIn this article, we focus on obtaining correct estimates of $\\beta$ in settings where we don’t have access to such an instrumental variable $Z$.\n\n## A Closer Look\n\nLet’s start with the heteroskedasticity-based approach of [Lewbel (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2012.643126).\n\n### Heteroskedasticity & Higher Moments\n\nThe main idea here is to construct valid instruments for $X_1$ by using information contained in the heteroskedasticity of $\\epsilon$. Intuitively, if $\\epsilon$ exhibits heteroskedasticity related to $ X_2$, we can use to create instruments—specifically by interacting $X_2$ with the residuals of the endogenous regressor’s reduced form equation. So, this is an IV-based method, but the instrument is “internal” to the model and does not rely on any external information.\n\nThe key assumptions are:\n\n- The error term in the structural equation ($\\epsilon$) is heteroskedastic. This means $var(\\epsilon|X_2)$ is not constant and depends on $X_2$. Moreover, we need $cov(X_2,\\epsilon^2) \\neq 0$. This is an analogue of the first stage assumption in IV methods.\n- The exogenous variable ($X_2$) are uncorrelated with the product of the endogeneous variable ($X_1$) and the error term ($\\epsilon$). That is, $cov(X_2, X_1\\epsilon) = 0$. This is a form of the standard exogeneity assumption in IV estimation.\n\nThe heteroskedasticity-based estimator of Lewbel (2012) proceeds in two steps:\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Algorithm:\"}\n1. Regress $X_1$ on $X_2$ and save the estimated residuals; call them $\\hat{u}$. Construct an instrument for $X_1$ as $\\tilde{Z}=(X_2-\\bar{X}_2)\\hat{u}$, where $\\bar{X}_2$ is the mean of $X_2$.\n2. Use $\\tilde{Z}$ as an instrument in a standard 2SLS estimation:\n  $$\\hat{\\beta}_{LEWBEL} = (X'P_{\\tilde{Z}}X)^{-1}X'P_{\\tilde{Z}}Y,$$\n\nwhere $P_{\\tilde{Z}}$ ​is the projection matrix onto the instrument.\n:::\n\nThis line of thought can also be extended to use higher moments as an alternative or additional way to construct instrumental variables. The original approach uses the variance of the error term, but we can also rely on skewness, kurtosis, etc. The assumptions then must be modified such that these higher moments are correlated with the endogenous variable, etc.\n\n*Software Packages*: [REndo](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/REndo), [ivlewbel](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ivlewbel).\n\n### Latent IVs\n\nThe [latent IV](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2817701) [approach](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11129-005-1177-6) imposes distributional assumptions on the exogenous part of the endogenous variable and employs likelihood-based methods to estimate $\\beta$.\n\nLet’s simplify the model above, so that we have:\n\n  $$ Y=\\beta X + \\epsilon, $$\n\nwhere $X$ is endogenous. The key idea is to decompose $X$ into two components:\n\n  $$ X= \\theta + \\nu, $$\n\nwith $cov(\\theta, \\epsilon)=0$, $cov(\\theta, \\nu) = 0$, and $cov(\\epsilon, \\nu)\\neq0$. The first condition states that $\\theta$ is the exogenous part of $X$, and the last one gives rise to the endogeneity problem.\n\nWe then proceed with adding distributional assumptions. Importantly, $\\theta$ must follow some discrete distribution with a finite number of mass points. A common example imposes:\n\n  $$ \\theta \\sim \\text{Multinomial}(\\cdot) $$\n\nand\n\n  $$ (\\epsilon, \\nu) \\sim \\text{Gaussian}(\\cdot). $$\n\nThese set of assumptions lead to analytical solutions for the conditional and unconditional distributions of $(Y,X)$ and all parameters of the model are identified. Maximum likelihood estimation can then give us an estimate of $\\beta_{LIV}$.\n\n*Software Packages*: [REndo](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/REndo).\n\n### Copulas\n\nFirst, a word on copulas. A copula is a multivariate cumulative distribution function (CDF) with uniform marginals on $[0,1]$. An old theorem states that any multivariate CDF can be expressed with uniform marginals and a copula function that represents the relationship between the variables. Specifically, if $A$ and $B$ are two random variables with marginal CDFs $F_A$ and $F_B$ and joint CDF $H$, then there exists a copula $C$ such that $H(a,b)=C(F_A(a), F_B(b))$.\n\nHow does this fit into our context and framework? [Park and Gupta (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.1120.0718) introduced two estimation methods for $\\beta$ under the assumption that $\\epsilon \\sim Gaussian(\\cdot)$. The key idea is positing a Gaussian copula to link the marginal distributions of $X$ and $\\epsilon$ and obtain their joint distribution. We can then estimate $\\beta$ in one of two ways: either impose distributional assumptions on these marginals and derive and maximize the joint likelihood function of $X$ and $\\epsilon$, or use a generated regressor approach. We will focus on the latter.\n\nIn the linear model, endogeneity is tackled by creating a novel variable $\\tilde{X}$ and adding that as a control (i.e., a generated regressor). Using our simplified model where $X$ is single-valued and endogenous, we now have:\n\n  $$Y=\\beta X + \\mu \\tilde{X} + \\eta, $$\n\nwhere $\\eta$ is the error term in this augmented model.\n\nWe construct $\\tilde{X}$ as follows:\n\n  $$\\tilde{X}=\\Phi^{-1}(\\hat{F}_X(X)).$$\n\nHere $\\Phi^{-1}(\\cdot)$ is the inverse CDF of the standard normal distribution and $F_X(\\cdot)$ is the marginal CDF of $X$. We can estimate the latter using the empirical CDF by sorting the observations in ascending order and calculating the proportion of rows with smaller values for each observation. As you can guess, this introduces further uncertainty into the model, so the standard errors should be estimated using bootstrap.\n\n*Software Packages*: [REndo](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/REndo), [copula](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/copula).\n\n### Comparison\n\nEach statistical method has its strengths and limitations. While the methods described here circumvent the traditional unconfoundedness and external instruments-based assumptions, they do not provide a magical panacea to the endogeneity problem. Instead, they rely on their own, different assumptions. These methods are not universally superior, but should be considered when traditional approaches do not fit your context.\n\nThe heteroskedasticity-based approach, as the name suggests, requires a considerable degree of heteroskedasticity to perform well. Latent IVs may offer efficiency advantages but come at the cost of imposing distributional assumptions and requiring a group structure of $X_1$. The copula-based approach, while simple to implement, also requires strong assumptions about the distributions of $X$ and $Y$, as well as their relationship.\n\nThat’s it. You are now equipped with a set of new methods designed to identify causal relationships in your data.\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n- Conventional methods used to tease causality rely on experiments or ambitious assumptions such as unconfoudedness or the access to valid instrumental variables.\n\n- Researchers have developed methods aimed at measuring causality without relying on these frameworks.\n\n- None of these are a panacea and they rely on their own assumptions that have to be checked on a case-by-case basis.\n\n## Where to Learn More\n\nEbbes, Wedel, and Bockenholt (2009), Park and Gupta (2012), Papies, Ebbes, and Heerde (2017), and Rutz and Watson (2019) provide detailed comparisons of these IV-free methods with alternative methods. Also, Qian et al. (2024) and Papadopolous (2022) and Baum and Lewbel (2019) have a practical angle that many data scientist will find accessible and attractive.\n\n## References\n\nBaum, C.

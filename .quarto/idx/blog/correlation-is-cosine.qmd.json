It certainly sounds intriguing—how can the simplest bivariate summary statistic be connected to a trigonometric function you first encountered in sixth grade? What exactly is the relationship between correlation and cosines?\n\n## A Closer Look\n\n### The Law of Cosines\n\nThe law of cosines states that in any triangle with sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ and an angle (between $x$ and $y$) $\\theta$, we have:\n\n$$ z^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y cos(\\theta), $$\n\nIn the special case when $\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the term on the right-hand side equals $0$ and the equation reduces to the well-known Pythagorean Theorem.\n\n### The Variance of the $A+B$\n\nLet’s imagine two random variables $A$, $B$. The variance of their sum is given by:\n\n$$ var(A+B) = var(A)+var(B)+2 cov(A,B), $$\n\nwhere $cov(\\cdot)$, denotes covariance. We can substitute the last term with its definition as follows:\n\n$$ var(A+B) = var(A)+var(B)+2 corr(A,B) sd(A) sd(B). $$\n\nNext, we know that $var(\\cdot)=sd^2(\\cdot)$. Substituting, we get:\n\n$$ sd^2(A+B) = sd^2 (A)+ sd^2 (B)+2 corr(A,B) sd(A) sd(B).$$\n\n### Putting the Two Together\n\nSetting $x=sd(A)$, $y=sd(B)$, and $z=sd(A+B)$ in the first equation gives the desired result. With one small caveat – the negative sign on the cosine term. To get around this we can simply look at the complementary angle $\\delta = \\pi - \\theta$.\n\nThat is, we imagine a triangle with sides equal to $sd(A)$, $sd(B)$ and $sd(A+B)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between $sd(A)$, $sd(B)$. When this angle is small ($\\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$), the two sides point in the same direction and A and B are positively correlated. The opposite is true for $\\theta > \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. As mentioned above, $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ kills the correlation term, consistent with $A$ and $B$ being independent.\n\n### Correlation as a Dot Product\n\nThere’s another way to see this connection that makes it even clearer.\n\nIf you think of $A$ and $B$ as vectors in $n$-dimensional space (e.g., $A = (a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)$), the cosine of the angle between them is given by:\n\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{\\|A\\| \\|B\\|},\n$$\n\nwhere $A \\cdot B$ is the dot product, and $\\|\\cdot\\|$ denotes the Euclidean norm. When $A$ and $B$ are standardized (i.e., mean zero and unit variance), this cosine becomes the Pearson correlation coefficient:\n\n$$\n\\text{corr}(A, B) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n A_i^* B_i^* \\approx \\cos(\\theta),\n$$\n\nwhere $A^*$ and $B^*$ are the standardized versions of $A$ and $B$.\n\n\n### Cosine Similarity vs. Correlation\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Cosine similarity vs. correlation\"}\n\nCosine similarity and Pearson correlation are closely related, but not always the same:\n\n- Cosine similarity considers only the **angle** between vectors. It's scale-invariant but not shift-invariant.\n- Correlation removes both **mean and scale**, making it invariant to affine transformations.\n\nSo, while “correlation is a cosine,” the statement is strictly true when you're working with **standardized vectors**.\n\n:::\n\n\n## An Example\n\nLet’s generate two random vectors, standardize them, compute their correlation and angle, and plot them as vectors. We'll also see how correlation equals the cosine of the angle between the vectors.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### R\n\n```r\nrm(list=ls())\nset.seed(1988)\n\n# Generate two random vectors\nA <- rnorm(100)\nB <- 0.8 * A + sqrt(1 - 0.8^2) * rnorm(100)  # Correlated with A\n\n# Standardize\nA_std <- scale(A)\nB_std <- scale(B)\n\n# Correlation and cosine\ncorrelation <- cor(A, B)\ncosine <- sum(A_std * B_std) / (sqrt(sum(A_std^2)) * sqrt(sum(B_std^2)))\nangle_deg <- acos(cosine) * 180 / pi\n\n# Print results\ncat(\"Correlation:\", round(correlation, 3), \"\\n\")\n> Correlation: 0.825 \ncat(\"Angle (degrees):\", round(angle_deg, 1), \"\\n\")\n> Angle (degrees): 34.4 \n\n# Plot vectors\nplot(c(0, A_std[1]), c(0, B_std[1]), type = \"n\", xlab = \"A (standardized)\", ylab = \"B (standardized)\",\n     main = \"First Vectors from A and B\")\narrows(0, 0, A_std[1], 0, col = \"blue\", lwd = 2)\narrows(0, 0, A_std[1], B_std[1], col = \"red\", lwd = 2)\nlegend(\"topright\", legend = c(\"A\", \"B\"), col = c(\"blue\", \"red\"), lwd = 2)\n```\n\n### Python\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nnp.random.seed(1988)\n\n# Generate two correlated vectors\nA = np.random.randn(100)\nB = 0.8 * A + np.sqrt(1 - 0.8**2) * np.random.randn(100)\n\n# Standardize\nA_std = (A - np.mean(A)) / np.std(A)\nB_std = (B - np.mean(B)) / np.std(B)\n\n# Correlation and cosine\ncorrelation = np.corrcoef(A, B)[0, 1]\ncosine = np.dot(A_std, B_std) / (np.linalg.norm(A_std) * np.linalg.norm(B_std))\nangle = np.arccos(np.clip(cosine, -1, 1)) * 180 / np.pi\n\nprint(f\"Correlation: {correlation:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"Angle (degrees): {angle:.1f}\")\n\n# Plot first two vectors\nplt.figure(figsize=(5, 5))\nplt.quiver(0, 0, A_std[0], 0, angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='blue', label='A')\nplt.quiver(0, 0, A_std[0], B_std[0], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='red', label='B')\nplt.xlim(-3, 3)\nplt.ylim(-3, 3)\nplt.xlabel(\"A (standardized)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"B (standardized)\")\nplt.title(\"First Vectors from A and B\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.gca().set_aspect('equal')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: \n\nIn this example, $cor(A,B)=0.825$ and the angle between the two vectors is $34.4^\\circ$, and we have $cos(34.4^\\circ) = cor(A,B)=0.825$.

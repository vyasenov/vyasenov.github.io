## Background

If you've ever dived into resampling methods, you've likely come across the **jackknife** and the **bootstrap**. They both aim to help us estimate uncertainty or bias without relying on strong parametric assumptions. And they sound similar: both create new datasets from the original one, and both involve recalculating the estimator across these datasets. So, what made the bootstrap, developed decades after the jackknife, such a big deal? Aren't they too similar to be considered separate methods and have distinct properties?

This article walks through the key intuition behind these methods and explains why the bootstrap was a genuine innovation.

## Notation

We observe a sample of data points $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$, and we’re interested in an estimator $\hat{\theta} = \hat{\theta}(X_1, \dots, X_n)$ such as the mean, median, or a regression coefficient. Our goal is to understand and quantify the variability or bias of $\hat{\theta}$.

## A Closer Look

### Smooth and Non-smooth Data Quantities

What does it mean for a quantity to be smooth? A smooth quantity is one that responds gradually to small changes in the data—technically, it's a statistic that is continuous or even differentiable as a function of the data points. The mean is a classic example: if you nudge any individual value slightly, the overall mean shifts just a little. In contrast, non-smooth quantities like the median can change abruptly; removing or altering a single observation may cause the median to jump, especially in small samples. This matters because the jackknife estimates bias and variance by systematically leaving out one observation at a time, and it performs best when the estimator varies smoothly with the data. When that assumption breaks, as it does with non-smooth statistics, the jackknife can give misleading results—whereas the bootstrap often still performs well.

### The Jackknife: Systematic Deletion

The jackknife, introduced by Quenouille and popularized by Tukey in the 1950s, works by **systematically leaving out one observation at a time**. For each $i$, we compute $\hat{\theta}^{(-i)}$, the estimator based on the dataset with the $i$th observation removed.

This gives us $n$ estimates to work with:
$$
\hat{\theta}^{(-1)}, \hat{\theta}^{(-2)}, \dots, \hat{\theta}^{(-n)}
$$

These can be used to estimate the bias or variance of $\hat{\theta}$. But the method assumes that the estimator behaves “smoothly” as data points change—a property that fails for medians, quantiles, and many modern estimators.

### The Bootstrap: Simulating the Sampling Distribution

The bootstrap, invented by Bradley Efron in 1979, made a conceptual leap: instead of deleting one observation at a time, **draw samples of size $n$ from the data, *with replacement*.** Each resample is like a new dataset:
$$
X_1^*, X_2^*, \dots, X_n^* \sim \text{Empirical distribution of } \{X_1, \dots, X_n\}
$$

Compute $\hat{\theta}^*$ for each resample. Repeat this many times—hundreds or thousands—and you get a full approximation of the sampling distribution of $\hat{\theta}$.

This approach doesn’t rely on linearity or smoothness. It works for medians, maximums, machine learning models—you name it. It does have limitations though. In [an earlier article](https://vyasenov.github.io/blog/bootstrap-limitations.html) I discussed some of the situations in which the bootstrap fails. Fun fact: Bradley Efron is still a professor of statistics at Stanford and can often be spotted in the front row at department seminars.

### The Conceptual Difference

- **Jackknife**: Analytic, leaves out one data point at a time.
- **Bootstrap**: Simulation-based, creates synthetic datasets by resampling with replacement.

The bootstrap became feasible thanks to improvements in computing. It provided a practical, general-purpose way to get confidence intervals and bias corrections for almost any estimator—not just the well-behaved ones.

## Bottom Line

- The jackknife is elegant but limited; it works best for linear, smooth estimators.

- The bootstrap is flexible and simulation-based, requiring no assumptions about estimator smoothness.

- Bootstrap’s strength lies in approximating the full sampling distribution—even for complex estimators.

- Efron's insight: use the data to simulate the data-generating process.

## Where to Learn More

A great place to start is Efron and Tibshirani’s classic *An Introduction to the Bootstrap*. For those seeking for a technical challenge, look at advanced resampling chapters in texts like Wasserman’s *All of Statistics* or Hastie and Efron's *Computer Age Statistical Inference*. You can never really go wrong with the latter two books.
